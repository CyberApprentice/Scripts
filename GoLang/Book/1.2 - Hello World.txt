1.1 - Hello World

Environment:
    Ubuntu 18.04.4 LTS
    2GB RAM
    1 CPU
    20 GB Storage
    Internet-connected
    IDE: Visual Studio Code

Steps:
    1. Code
        package main    // required for main soure files
        import "fmt"    // prints formatted output and scanning input

        func main() {
            fmt.Println("Hello, World")     // import used
        }


    2. Compile
        $ go build helloworld.go

    3. Run the file
        Method 1 (without compiling):
            $ go run helloworld.go
        Method 2 (after compiling/building):
            $ ./helloworld


Learned:
    - All source files require a "package" declaration
    - the "main" package defines an execuitable and not a library.
    - Functions/methods begin with "func"
    - Opening brace ('{') cannot standalone 
    - Doesn't have to end with semi-colon unless they are one-liners
    - run "gofmt <file>.go" to check the formatting
