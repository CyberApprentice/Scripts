Using Cargo

Environment:
    Ubuntu 18.04.4 LTS
    2GB RAM
    1 CPU
    20 GB Storage
    Internet-connected

Steps:
    1. Create a Cargo Workspace
        $ cargo new <name>
    2. Run the program local to the Workspace
        $ cargo run     # builds + runs
    3. Check for errors (faster than build)
        $ cargo Check
    4. Build for sharing
        $ cargo build --release

Learned:
    - Cargo.toml = version and crates (dependencies)
    - ./target/debug/* = executable is stored (regular version)
    - ./target/release/* = executable is stored (production version)
    - The difference between release and the regular version is the release version is built with optimizations to make it faster to execute but longer to compile
