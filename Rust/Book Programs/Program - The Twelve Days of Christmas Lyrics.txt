        /* Lyrics:

        On the first day of Christmas my true love gave to me
        A partridge in a pear tree

        On the second day of Christmas my true love gave to me
        Two turtle doves and a partridge in a pear tree

        On the third day of Christmas my true love gave to me
        Three French hens, two turtle doves and a partridge in a pear tree

        On the fourth day of Christmas my true love gave to me
        Four calling birds, three French hens
        Two turtle doves and a partridge in a pear tree

        On the fifth day of Christmas my true love gave to me
        Five gold rings, four calling birds, three French hens
        Two turtle doves and a partridge in a pear tree

        On the sixth day of Christmas my true love gave to me
        Six geese a laying, five gold rings
        Four calling birds, three French hens
        Two turtle doves and a partridge in a pear tree

        On the seventh day of Christmas my true love gave to me
        Seven swans a swimming, six geese a laying, five gold rings
        Four calling birds, three French hens
        Two turtle doves and a partridge in a pear tree

        On the eighth day of Christmas my true love gave to me
        Eight maids a milking, seven swans a swimming
        Six geese a laying, five gold rings
        Four calling birds, three French hens
        Two turtle doves and a partridge in a pear tree

        On the ninth day of Christmas
        Nine ladies dancing, eight maids a milking
        Seven swans a swimming, six geese a laying, five gold rings
        Four calling birds, three French hens
        Two turtle doves and a partridge in a pear tree

        On the tenth day of Christmas my true love gave to me
        Ten lords a leaping, nine ladies dancing, eight maids a milking
        Seven swans a swimming, six geese a laying, five gold rings
        Four calling birds, three French hens
        Two turtle doves and a partridge in a pear tree

        On the eleventh day of Christmas my true love gave to me
        Eleven pipers piping, ten lords a leaping
        Nine ladies dancing, eight maids a milking
        Seven swans a swimming, six geese a laying, five gold rings
        Four calling birds, three French hens
        Two turtle doves and a partridge in a pear tree

        On the twelfth day of Christmas my true love gave to me
        Twelve drummers drumming, eleven pipers piping
        Ten lords a leaping, nine ladies dancing, eight maids a milking
        Seven swans a swimming, six geese a laying, five gold rings
        Four calling birds, three French hens
        Two turtle doves and a partridge in a pear tree

Learned:
    - Remember that variables (e.g. index) used in loops must be of size usize and mutable.
    - Index values to iterate through arrays require 'minus 1'
