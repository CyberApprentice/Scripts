Problem: Generate the nth Fibonacci number

Environment:
    Ubuntu 18.04.4 LTS
    2GB RAM
    1 CPU
    20 GB Storage
    Internet-connected

Steps:
    1. Create Cargo project
        $ cargo new fibonacci_generator

    2. Crates
        use std::io;

    3. Code
        use std::io;

        fn main()
        {
            loop
            {
                println!("Please enter a fibonacci number to generate:\t");

                let mut number = String::new(); // variable to store user input

                // user input
                io::stdin()
                    .read_line(&mut number)
                    .expect("Failed to read line");
                
                // convert String to Integer for calculation
                let number: u128 = match number
                                        .trim()
                                        .parse()
                                    {
                                        Ok(num) => num,
                                        Err(_) => continue,
                                    };
                
                println!("The desired to calculate the fibonacci of {}.", number);                    
                
                // calculations
                if number == 0
                {
                    println!("Output: 0");
                }
                else
                {   
                    // This portion was stolen. Wasn't sure if knowing the formula was required or not, but I didn't know it so looked it up.
                    let mut index: u128 = 0;
                    let mut previous_fib: u128 = 0;
                    let mut current_fib: u128 = 1;
                    let mut new_fid: u128 = 0;

                    while index < number -1
                    {
                        new_fid = previous_fib + current_fib;
                        previous_fib = current_fib;
                        current_fib = new_fid;

                        index+=1;   // increment by 1
                    }

                    println!("Output: {}", new_fid);
                }
            }
        }

    4. run
        $ cargo run

Learned:
    - nth Fib formula
