11.2 - Controlling how tests are run

Environment:
    Ubuntu 18.04.4 LTS
    2GB RAM
    1 CPU
    20 GB Storage
    Internet-connected

Steps:
    1. Create Cargo project
        N/A

    2. Crates
        N/A

    3. Code
        N/A

    4. run
        $ cargo run

Learned:
    - "cargo test -- --show-output" to show output of functions 
        - Ex: println!
    - "cargo test <function name>" to only run a test on that name
        - If multiple functions have the same name, and you only use the prefix, all of those tests can run as well
            - Ex: fn add_one(), fn add_two(), fn sub_three()
                    cargo test add
                - This will run add_one() and add_two() and filter out (not run) sub_three()
            - tests that do not match the function will be labeled as "filtered out"
    - Exclude certain tests (functions) by adding #[ignore] under #[test]
        - Tests excluded will be labeled as "ignored"
        - to run only the ignored tests do, "cargo test -- --ignored"
