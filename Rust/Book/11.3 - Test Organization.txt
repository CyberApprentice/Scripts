Environment:
    Ubuntu 18.04.4 LTS
    2GB RAM
    1 CPU
    20 GB Storage
    Internet-connected

Steps:
    1. Create Cargo project
        - continued in adder/* from 11.2

    2. Crates
        N/A

    3. Code
        N/A

    4. run
        $ cargo run

Learned:
    - unit tests only test one module at a time
    - integration tests are external to my library and tests multiple modules
        - requires a "test" directory at the same level as "src" so Rust knows where to for integration tests
        - requires a src/lib.rs
            - library crates expose functions that can be used else where. Binary crates (main.rs) are run on their own
    - private functions can be tested
