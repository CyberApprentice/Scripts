Data Types

Environment:
    Ubuntu 18.04.4 LTS
    2GB RAM
    1 CPU
    20 GB Storage
    Internet-connected

Steps:
    1. Create Cargo project
        $ cargo new <name>
        
    2. Crates
        <crates>

    3. Code
        <code>

    4. run
        $ cargo run

Learned:
    - signed vs unsigned
        - signed (+ or -) = can go negative
            - Ex: i8 stores -128 to 127
        - unsigned = cannot go negative because there is not a "sign" to denote positive or negative. Positive is assumed.
            - Ex: u8 stores 0 to 255
        - If you use a number outside of the allocated space (e.g. 128 for i8), the code will panic during compiling.
            - If the code is being released for production (--release), it will perform modulo via the number cap and return the result (e.g. i8 = 128 % 127 = 1. 1 will be used in the program instead of 128)
            - These functions prevent integer overflow
        - Default number data type is i32
    - Floating points
        - f64 is default as it has more precision than f32
    - Char
        - uses single quotes instead of double quotes
        - Is Unicode, so uses more than ASCII (e.g. Accented letters; Chinese, Japanese, and Korean characters; emoji; and more)
    - Tuples
        - groups different types
        - fixed in length (i.e. cannot grow or shrink)
        - Uses parentheses
    - Arrays
        - all values must be the same type
        - Also fixed length
        - Uses brackets to define
