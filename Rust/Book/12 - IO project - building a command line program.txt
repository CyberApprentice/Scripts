Learned:
    - Any time you use the collect() function, you must annotate the data type because collect() can be used for any collection type
    - Split a program into main.rs and lib.rs
        - main.rs holds the error handling, calls to functions in lib.rs and command line arguments
        - lib.rs holds the program's logic
            - This allows the programmer to test the functions in lib.rs as you can't test functions in main.rs
    - Tests:
        - test driven development process
            - write a test to intentionally fail
            - then make the test pass
    - eprintln! prints errors to stderr instead of stdout
