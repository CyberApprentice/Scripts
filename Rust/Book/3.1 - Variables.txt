Variables

Environment:
    Ubuntu 18.04.4 LTS
    2GB RAM
    1 CPU
    20 GB Storage
    Internet-connected

Steps:
    1. Create Cargo project
        $ cargo new variables
        
    2. Crates
        N/A

    3. Code
        fn main() {
        let mut x = 10000;
        println!("The value of x is: {}", x);

        x = 10_000;
        println!("The value of x is: {}", x);
        }


    4. run
        $ cargo run

Learned:
    - variables vs constants
        - Constants
            - ALWAYS immutable
            - all caps
        - variables
            - immutable by default, but through "mut" can become mutable.
    - Naming convention is underscores to represent spaces instead of Camal casing
    - Defining variables as values can use underscores for readability (100000 or 100_000 equal the same output)
    - shadowing vs. mutable 
        - mutable (mut) variables are used when a variable's value is constantly changing.
        - shadowing is used when crossing data types (from string to int) by completely redefining the variable under the same name
