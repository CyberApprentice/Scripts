The Slice Type

Environment:
    Ubuntu 18.04.4 LTS
    2GB RAM
    1 CPU
    20 GB Storage
    Internet-connected

Steps:
    1. Create Cargo project
        $ cargo new slice

    2. Crates
        N/A

    3. Code
        <code>

    4. run
        $ cargo run

Learned:
    - "let <variable> = &s[starting_index..ending_index]" syntax
        - Ex: let s = String::from("hello world");
                let hello = &s[0..5]; 
        - ending_index is the last byte + 1. In the example above 0 = 'h' and 5 = ' ' (space). However, slicing uses this method to represent "hello" (without the space)
        - can also use [..5] when starting from 0.
    - &str = string slice data type
    - String slices = String literals
    - In other words, always use &str instead of &String data types as it makes the code more general without losing functionality
        - Instead of passing strings like "funtion(&some_string)", use "function(&some_string[..])" to pass the entire string
    - The slice syntax on Strings applies to arrays too!
